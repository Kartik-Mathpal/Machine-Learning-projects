These are some of the Machine Learning projects that I have done. 
1. Linear Regression: Conducted an analysis to identify key variables influencing car prices, providing actionable insights for a Chinese car manufacturer planning to enter the American market.

2. Logistic Regression: Developed a predictive model to assist an online education company in improving its lead conversion rate by accurately identifying high-priority "hot leads," enabling targeted marketing efforts.
