# Machine-Learning-projects
These are some of the Machine Learning projects that I have done. 
- Linear Regression - In this project the task was to find the variables that are significant in predicting the car price. This analysis will help a Chinese car maker that wants to enter American market.
- Logistics Regression - In this project the task was to help an online education company to increase its lead conversion rate by focusing more on leads that have high probabiity of conversion (Hot Leads). This model will help the company to identify hot leads with high accuracy.
